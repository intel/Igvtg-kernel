	  Choose this option if you have a system that has "Intel Graphics
	  Media Accelerator" or "HD Graphics" integrated graphics,
	  including 830M, 845G, 852GM, 855GM, 865G, 915G, 945G, 965G,
	  G35, G41, G43, G45 chipsets and Celeron, Pentium, Core i3,
	  Core i5, Core i7 as well as Atom CPUs with integrated graphics.
	  If M is selected, the module will be called i915.  AGP support
	  is required for this driver to work. This driver is used by
	  the Intel driver in X.org 6.8 and XFree86 4.4 and above. It
	  replaces the older i830 module that supported a subset of the
	  hardware in older X.org releases.

	  Note that the older i810/i815 chipsets require the use of the
	  i810 driver instead, and the Atom z5xx series has an entirely
	  different implementation.

	help
	  Choose this option if you have prerelease Intel hardware and want the
	  i915 driver to support it by default.  You can enable such support at
	  runtime with the module option i915.preliminary_hw_support=1; this
	  option changes the default for that module option.

	  If in doubt, say "N".

	  Enabling vGT mediated graphics passthrough technique for Intel i915
	  based integrated graphics card. With vGT, it's possible to have one
	  integrated i915 device shared by multiple VMs. Performance critical
	  opterations such as apperture accesses and ring buffer operations
	  are pass-throughed to VM, with a minimal set of conflicting resources
	  (e.g. display settings) mediated by vGT driver. The benefit of vGT
	  is on both the performance, given that each VM could directly operate
	  its aperture space and submit commands like running on native, and
	  the feature completeness, given that a true GEN hardware is exposed.
